          Why the "About Us" Page Rocks: It tells us a story. When you have a
          great story about how your product or service was built to change
          lives, share it. The "About Us" page is a great place for it to live,
          too. Good stories humanize your brand, providing context and meaning
          for your product. Whatâ€™s more, good stories are sticky -- which means
          people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.

          Yellow Leaf Hammocks tells users about its product by describing how
          the hammocks empower artisan weavers and their families. The company
          breaks down different pieces of the story into sections that combine
          words and easily digestible graphics, painting a picture instead of
          big chunks of text. They're clear about why they're different: "Not a
          Charity," the page reads. And then: "This is the basis for a brighter
          future, built on a hand up, not a handout."

          Every company has a story to tell, so break out your storytelling
          skills from that random English class you took years ago and put them
          to work on your "About Us" page. Using descriptive and emotive copy
          and gorgeous graphics, an "About Us" page with a story works harder
          for your business than a generic one.

          "About Us" pages might encompass the values of more than one person or
          entity, but they're no more important to the image of a business than
          your personal about page. Take Joe Payton's "About Me" page, below.

          Not only does Joe's illustrative self-portrait give him a personal
          brand that customers will remember, but it also demonstrates his
          expertise as a designer and animator. His website visitors can learn
          not just what he does, but why he does it, in an easily digestible
          way. Being able to express his values as a creative professional in
          such a well-organized page is something to be desired by anyone
          creating their own about page.
